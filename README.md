The Chrome plugin when clicked will copy the backend ticket ID of the last loaded Freshdesk ticket URL to your clipboard, so that you can paste it into haystack, without additional clicks or opening the ticket URL. This should be handy when checking logs for multiple tickets in multiple tabs.

How does the extension work:
1. Load a ticket URL in a Chrome tab
2. Once the URL is loaded, click on the Chrome extension
3. The backend ticket ID will be copied automatically
4. A button to change the Timestamps to the System's Local time(Mostly IST) is given.


Things to take care when you use the extension:

1. The extension will have the last loaded ticket Display ID and backend ticket ID when you click on it make sure the expected display id is shown
2. Once you click the extension icon, whatever copied previously will be rewritten with the backend ticket ID. Hence take care to use the extension only before checking logs.
